  <h1>About Me</h1>
  My name is <b>Kim Nguyen</b>.<br> 
  My major is computer science.<br>
  I grew up in <i>Boston, MA.</i><br>
  IP address: 130.64.225.3<br>
  Something no one would expect about me: 
  <ul>
    <li>I tried to make caramel and ended up burning a few pots. Almost the kitchen.</li>
    <li>I used to learn martial arts and karate.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr>
  My favorite place is <i>Da Nang, Vietnam</i>. The image below is of the Golden Bridge at Ba Na Hills.<br>
  I went up to the tip of a mountain, where there were different sites to see.<br>
  Majority of the buildings were built to look like mid-century Europe.<br>
